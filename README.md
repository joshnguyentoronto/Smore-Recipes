### User Persona:

Alana
No-frill camper.
Cooks simple meals, but not just burgers and hot dogs.
Doesn’t want to bring a lot of stuff with her, ideally one cooking tool.

### Needs:

Quick but delicious Meals
Switch up between burgers, hot dogs with home cooked meals.
Access recipes offline at camp site.

### Frustration:

Wants to plan better meals for camping but don’t know how to do it minimally.
Time consuming to Google recipes and manually save them for every trip.

### User Testing Notes 2022-02-11

Ricardo: Explore option is key for me to see more recipes. I’d want to go to ‘explore’ from my planned trips too.
Eric: Add trip function was inconsistent at the recipe page compared to the ‘My trips’ page.
I don’t like to be constrained with the type of cooking tools usually. I want to explore and add any recipes to my trips folder and then decide what tools I need to bring to the camping trip.
