#### User Persona:

Alana\
No-frill camper.\
Cooks simple meals, but not just burgers and hot dogs.\
Doesn’t want to bring a lot of stuff with her, ideally one cooking tool.

#### Needs:

Quick but delicious Meals.\
Switch up between burgers, hot dogs with home cooked meals.\
Access recipes offline at camp site.

#### Frustration:

Wants to plan better meals for camping but don’t know how to do it minimally.\
Time consuming to Google recipes and manually save them for every trip.

#### User Testing Notes 2022-02-11

Ricardo: Explore option is key for me to see more recipes. I’d want to go to ‘explore’ from my planned trips too.\
Eric: Add trip function was inconsistent at the recipe page compared to the ‘My trips’ page.\
I don’t like to be constrained with the type of cooking tools usually. I want to explore and add any recipes to my trips folder and then decide what tools I need to bring to the camping trip.
